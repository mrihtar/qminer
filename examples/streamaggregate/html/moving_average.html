    <h1>Moving average</h1>
    <p>
        Every second we store the values of a brownian motion (to the current value we add a random value taken from the standard
        gaussian distribution and store it).
    </p>
    <p>
        Then we use the <b>moving average</b> stream aggregator, which is connected with the store. By using the stream aggregator,
        we can smooth the graph and get a clearer representation of the values we get. It is useful when we want to see how are the
        values changing by trying to minimize the noise of the data. Before we could use the stream aggregator, we needed to construct
        the <b>time series window buffer</b> stream aggregator, that is connected to the store. Then we connect the moving average
        to the time series window buffer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The graphs bellow represent the brownian motion and the smoothen values gained by the moving average stream aggregator.
