    <h1>Merger</h1>
    <p>
        We are now storing two values from the standard gaussian distribution in two different stores, respectively. These values
        are stored at different time intervals for each store. Now we want to have all these values stored in one store, where
        every record contains both values of the two stores and the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is when we use the <b>merger</b> stream aggregator. It merges records from the two stores into a new store. We allready
        constructed the new store, in which we'll store the new records. We have to give the following values to the merger: where to
        store the merged records, where the timestamp should be saved and which stores (store fields) we want to use for the merger
        and what kind of the interpolation we want to use: 'previous'. 'linear' or 'next'.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first graph bellow represents the values of the two stores. The second graph represent the values from the merger store.

        The following graph show the values of the two stores and the values of merger store on the same chart.
